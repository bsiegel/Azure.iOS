# Azure Communication Chat Service client library for iOS

This package contains the Chat client library for Azure Communication Services.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/tree/master/sdk/communication/AzureCommunicationChat)
| [API reference documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-ios/AzureCommunicationChat/index.html)
| [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* The client library is written in modern Swift 5. Due to this, Xcode 10.2 or higher is required to use this library.
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a
[Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource) to use this library.

### Versions available
The latest version of the SDK is [1.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.2). Older [releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/releases) are also available.

> Note: The SDK is currently in **beta**. The API surface and feature sets are subject to change at any time before they become generally available. We do not currently recommend them for production use.

### Install the library
To install the Azure client libraries for iOS, we recommend you use
[Swift Package Manager](#add-a-package-dependency-with-swift-package-manager).

#### Add a package dependency with Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code.
Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Xcode comes with built-in support for Swift Package Manager and source control accounts and makes it easy to leverage
available Swift packages. Use Xcode to manage the versions of package dependencies and make sure your project has the
most up-to-date code changes.

##### Xcode

To add the library to your application, follow the instructions in
[Adding Package Dependencies to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app):

With your project open in Xcode 11 or later, select **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...** Enter the
clone URL of this repository: *https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios.git* and click **Next**. For the version rule,
specify the exact version or version range you wish to use with your application and click **Next**. Finally, place a
checkmark next to the library, ensure your application target is selected in the **Add to target** dropdown, and click
**Finish**.

##### Swift CLI

To add the library to your application, follow the example in
[Importing Dependencies](https://swift.org/package-manager/#importing-dependencies):

Open your project's `Package.swift` file and add a new package dependency to your project's `dependencies` section,
specifying the clone URL of this repository and the version specifier you wish to use:

```swift
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios.git", from: "1.0.0-beta.2")
    ],
```

Next, for each target that needs to use the library, add it to the target's array of `dependencies`:
```swift
    targets: [
        ...
        .target(
            name: "MyTarget",
            dependencies: ["AzureCommunicationChat", ...])
    ]
)
```

### Create the AzureCommunicationChatClient

Create an instance of `AzureCommunicationChatClient` by providing the base URL of the service, the authentication policy to use, and the set of options to use for the client.

```swift
import AzureCommunication
import AzureCommunicationChat
import AzureCore

guard let baseUrl = URL(string: "https://<resource>.communication.azure.com") else {
    // Display error message
}

let authPolicy = try CommunicationUserCredentialPolicy(
    credential: credential ?? CommunicationUserCredential(token: "<user_access_token>")
)
let options = AzureCommunicationChatClientOptions(
    logger: ClientLoggers.default,
    dispatchQueue: self.queue
)
let client = AzureCommunicationChatClient(baseUrl: baseUrl, authPolicy: authPolicy, withOptions: options)
```

## Key concepts

### User and User Access Tokens

User access tokens enable you to build client applications that directly authenticate to Azure Communication Services. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens) to learn how to create a user and issue a User Access Token.

The id for the user created above will be necessary later to add said user as a member of a new chat thread. The initiator of the create request must be in the list of members of the chat thread.

### Chat Thread

A chat conversation is represented by a chat thread. Each user in the thread is called a thread member. Thread members can chat with one another privately in a 1:1 chat or huddle up in a 1:N group chat.

Using the APIs, users can also send typing indicators when typing a message and read receipts for the messages they have read in a chat thread. To learn more, read about chat concepts [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/chat/concepts).

### Chat Operations

## Examples

### Thread Operations

#### Create a thread

Use the `create` method to create a thread.

- `displayName`, optional, is the display name for the thread member.
- `shareHistoryTime`, optional, is the time from which the chat history is shared with the member.

`MultiStatusResponse` is the result returned from creating a thread. It has a 'multipleStatus' property which represents a list of `IndividualStatusResponse`.

```swift
let thread = CreateChatThreadRequest(
    topic: "General",
    members: [ChatThreadMember(
        id: <userId>,
        // Id of this needs to match with the Auth token
        displayName: "initial member"
    )]
)

client.create(chatThread: thread) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .success(createThreadResponse):
        var threadId: String? = nil
        for response in createThreadResponse.multipleStatus ?? [] {
            if response.id?.hasSuffix("@thread.v2") ?? false,
                response.type ?? "" == "Thread" {
                threadId = response.id
            }

        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

### Events Operations

#### Send a typing notification

Use the `sendTypingNotification` method to post a typing notification event to a thread, on behalf of a user.

```swift
client.sendTypingNotification(chatThreadId: threadId) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

#### Send read receipt

- `SendReadReceiptRequest` is the model to be passed to this method.
- `chatMessageId` is the unique ID of the message.
- `chatThreadId` is the unique ID of the thread.

```swift
let readReceipt = SendReadReceiptRequest(chatMessageId: messageId)

client.send(chatReadReceipt: readReceipt, chatThreadId: threadId) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Take further action

    case let .failure(error):

        var iterator = readReceipts.syncIterator
        while let readReceipt = iterator.next() {
            // Take further action
        }

    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

When an error occurs, the client calls the callback, passing in a `failure` result. You can use the provided error to act upon the failure.

```swift
client.create(chatThread: thread) { result, _ in
    switch result {
    case let .failure(error):
        // Display error message
    }
}
```
